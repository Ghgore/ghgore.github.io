During the HiveTracks discussions, I learned sometimes even projects managed by public universities can suffer from ownership issues that can cause the data to not be freely available in some cases, that there are many types of honey, with a type known as sourwood being produced right here on the Blue Ridge, and that there are several bee health issues, some of which are dealt with by using unapproved substances.

I think my main takeaway is to always think carefully about how I use data, and how other people may want to use user data I may collect.
