The most important things I learned in this class, is how valuable bees are and the difficult in managing them, how valuable and important my personal privacy is, and how easy it is to find my personal information online from readily available sources.

My advice for students next semester is to not wait until the last minute to do all the assignments for the class, and to due them as you go, even if you don't follow all the dates exactly.
