I recently was going through some of my old files from the programming class I took sophomore year, and I found a cool little project I made called "Astronomy Info". It basically just shows info about various planets organized by galaxy and solar system.

I decided to open source it on my GitHub, just to showcase the kind of stuff I made in that class (and possibly how cringe my sophomore self was lol).
